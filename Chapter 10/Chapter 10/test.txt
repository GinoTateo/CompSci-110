Pretend that you have been hired by the National Security Agency (NSA) to write a program that
scrambles the text in a text file, and rewrites it as a new file. Someone else will be hired to write a
program to unscramble the file and output it to the console screen. In this way, the NSA can put
secret messages into text files, scramble the files with your program, and send them as attachments
to email. The recipients of the email messages will use the decoder program to read the file and
display the original message.
